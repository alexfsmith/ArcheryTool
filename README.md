# ArcheryTool

A tool designed to help archers score rounds and tune their bows.

Currently functional:
- Score an indoor round for one archer
- Score arrows by clicking on the target

Currently in progress:
- Score imperial and metric indoor and outdoor rounds
- Score up to 4 archers at once
- 5-zone scoring for compound archers
- Tuning advice for based on fletched and bareshaft arrow placement

Ideas for the future:
- Review old rounds
- 3 spot target faces
- Non-standard target faces (eg Worcester)
